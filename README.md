# Santa-Bot

A chatbot application built with React, featuring dynamic responses powered by the Gemini API. The chatbot provides a seamless user experience with typing animations, smooth scrolling, and engaging Lottie animations.

## Features

- **Gemini API Integration**: Generates intelligent and context-aware responses.
- **Typing Animation**: Simulates typing before the bot responds.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Ensures the latest messages are always visible.
- **Interactive Lottie Animations**: Animations change based on the bot's activity state.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Gemini API**: For generating chatbot responses.
- **Lottie**: For displaying engaging animations.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and layout.

## How It Works

1. User types a message into the input box and presses **Enter** or clicks **Send**.
2. The message is sent to the Gemini API to generate a response.
3. A typing animation plays while the bot waits for the API response.
4. The bot displays the response, and the chat window scrolls automatically to the latest message.
